# Doxyfile 1.8.1.2

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
#       TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists items can also be appended using:
#       TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ").

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the config file
# that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all
# text before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the
# iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See
# http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv for the list of possible encodings.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or sequence of words) that should
# identify the project. Note that if you do not use Doxywizard you need
# to put quotes around the project name if it contains spaces.

PROJECT_NAME           = "PTreeGenerator"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number.
# This could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or
# if some version control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         = "1.0"

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer
# a quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "Simple phylogenetic tree generation from multiple sequence alignment."

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify an logo or icon that is
# included in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not
# exceed 55 pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels.
# Doxygen will copy the logo to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           =

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute)
# base path where the generated documentation will be put.
# If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the location
# where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = "."

# The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all
# documentation generated by doxygen is written. Doxygen will use this
# information to generate all constant output in the proper language.
# The default language is English, other supported languages are:
# Afrikaans, Arabic, Brazilian, Catalan, Chinese, Chinese-Traditional,
# Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, Farsi, Finnish, French, German,
# Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Japanese-en (Japanese with English
# messages), Korean, Korean-en, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Macedonian, Persian,
# Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Serbian-Cyrillic, Slovak,
# Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.

OUTPUT_LANGUAGE        = English

# The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab.
# Doxygen uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments.

TAB_SIZE               = 4

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA tag to YES if your project consists of Java
# sources only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for
# Java. For instance, namespaces will be presented as packages, qualified
# scopes will look different, etc.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA   = YES

# If MARKDOWN_SUPPORT is enabled (the default) then doxygen pre-processes all
# comments according to the Markdown format, which allows for more readable
# documentation. See http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ for details.
# The output of markdown processing is further processed by doxygen, so you
# can mix doxygen, HTML, and XML commands with Markdown formatting.
# Disable only in case of backward compatibilities issues.

MARKDOWN_SUPPORT       = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available.
# Private class members and static file members will be hidden unless
# the EXTRACT_PRIVATE and EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES

EXTRACT_ALL            = YES

# If the EXTRACT_PRIVATE tag is set to YES all private members of a class
# will be included in the documentation.

EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = YES

# If the EXTRACT_PACKAGE tag is set to YES all members with package or internal scope will be included in the documentation.

EXTRACT_PACKAGE        = YES

# If the EXTRACT_STATIC tag is set to YES all static members of a file
# will be included in the documentation.

EXTRACT_STATIC         = YES

# If the EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES tag is set to YES classes (and structs)
# defined locally in source files will be included in the documentation.
# If set to NO only classes defined in header files are included.

EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES  = YES

# This flag is only useful for Objective-C code. When set to YES local
# methods, which are defined in the implementation section but not in
# the interface are included in the documentation.
# If set to NO (the default) only methods in the interface are included.

EXTRACT_LOCAL_METHODS  = YES

# If this flag is set to YES, the members of anonymous namespaces will be
# extracted and appear in the documentation as a namespace called
# 'anonymous_namespace{file}', where file will be replaced with the base
# name of the file that contains the anonymous namespace. By default
# anonymous namespaces are hidden.

EXTRACT_ANON_NSPACES   = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like "myfile.cpp" or
# directories like "/usr/src/myproject". Separate the files or directories
# with spaces.

INPUT                  = "../src"

# This tag can be used to specify the character encoding of the source files
# that doxygen parses. Internally doxygen uses the UTF-8 encoding, which is
# also the default input encoding. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the iconv built
# into libc) for the transcoding. See http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv for
# the list of possible encodings.

INPUT_ENCODING         = UTF-8

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp
# and *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left
# blank the following patterns are tested:
# *.c *.cc *.cxx *.cpp *.c++ *.d *.java *.ii *.ixx *.ipp *.i++ *.inl *.h *.hh
# *.hxx *.hpp *.h++ *.idl *.odl *.cs *.php *.php3 *.inc *.m *.mm *.dox *.py
# *.f90 *.f *.for *.vhd *.vhdl

FILE_PATTERNS          = *.py

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to turn specify whether or not subdirectories
# should be searched for input files as well. Possible values are YES and NO.
# If left blank NO is used.

RECURSIVE              = YES

# The EXCLUDE tag can be used to specify files and/or directories that should be
# excluded from the INPUT source files. This way you can easily exclude a
# subdirectory from a directory tree whose root is specified with the INPUT tag.
# Note that relative paths are relative to the directory from which doxygen is
# run.

EXCLUDE                = "../src/tests/"

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to source browsing
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the SOURCE_BROWSER tag is set to YES then a list of source files will
# be generated. Documented entities will be cross-referenced with these sources.
# Note: To get rid of all source code in the generated output, make sure also
# VERBATIM_HEADERS is set to NO.

SOURCE_BROWSER         = YES

# Setting the INLINE_SOURCES tag to YES will include the body
# of functions and classes directly in the documentation.

INLINE_SOURCES         = YES

# Setting the STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS tag to YES (the default) will instruct
# doxygen to hide any special comment blocks from generated source code
# fragments. Normal C, C++ and Fortran comments will always remain visible.

STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS    = NO

# If the REFERENCED_BY_RELATION tag is set to YES
# then for each documented function all documented
# functions referencing it will be listed.

REFERENCED_BY_RELATION = YES

# If the REFERENCES_RELATION tag is set to YES
# then for each documented function all documented entities
# called/used by that function will be listed.

REFERENCES_RELATION    = NO

# If the REFERENCES_LINK_SOURCE tag is set to YES (the default)
# and SOURCE_BROWSER tag is set to YES, then the hyperlinks from
# functions in REFERENCES_RELATION and REFERENCED_BY_RELATION lists will
# link to the source code.
# Otherwise they will link to the documentation.

REFERENCES_LINK_SOURCE = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the LaTeX output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will
# generate Latex output.

GENERATE_LATEX         = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the dot tool
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the CLASS_DIAGRAMS tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will
# generate a inheritance diagram (in HTML, RTF and LaTeX) for classes with base
# or super classes. Setting the tag to NO turns the diagrams off. Note that
# this option also works with HAVE_DOT disabled, but it is recommended to
# install and use dot, since it yields more powerful graphs.

CLASS_DIAGRAMS         = YES

# If the UML_LOOK tag is set to YES doxygen will generate inheritance and
# collaboration diagrams in a style similar to the OMG's Unified Modeling
# Language.

UML_LOOK               = YES
